## [0.4.9] - 2025-09-05 21:30 EEST - Total Recall and Restructuring Process

### Major Restructuring
- **Project Reassessment** - Complete evaluation of current implementation vs. original planning
- **Resource Reality Check** - Identified hardware limitations (16GB VRAM vs. planned 80GB+ requirements)
- **Model Strategy Revision** - Redesigned model orchestration for practical resource usage
- **Phase Restructuring** - Complete phase reorganization based on actual capabilities
- **Smart Model Router** - Implemented resource-efficient model management system

### What Went Wrong
- **Over-ambitious Model Strategy** - Planned 6+ models simultaneously (80GB+ VRAM needed)
- **Hardware Mismatch** - System has 16GB VRAM, not 24GB+ as initially assumed
- **Missing Core Features** - RAG, vector memory, RPG mechanics not implemented
- **Incomplete Planning** - Phase 2 marked complete without actual AI integration
- **Resource Management** - No consideration for practical model loading/swapping

### What We Learned
- **Resource Planning** - Must consider actual hardware capabilities
- **Incremental Development** - Build core features first, add complexity gradually
- **Model Efficiency** - Smart routing better than running all models simultaneously
- **RPG Focus** - Need proper game mechanics integration, not just chat responses
- **Memory System** - ChromaDB setup without RAG implementation is incomplete

### New Approach
- **Smart Model Router** - Dynamic model loading based on task requirements
- **Resource Management** - VRAM monitoring and model swapping
- **Core-First Strategy** - Focus on essential RPG features before advanced AI
- **Practical Phases** - Realistic milestones based on actual capabilities
- **Proper Testing** - Each phase must be fully functional before proceeding

### Technical Changes
- **SmartModelRouter** - New resource-efficient model management system
- **Model Strategy** - Revised for 16GB VRAM system (2 primary + 2 on-demand)
- **Phase Structure** - Complete restructuring with realistic timelines
- **Documentation** - Updated all planning documents with lessons learned

### Files Modified
- `PHASE_RESTRUCTURE.md` - New phase structure based on reality
- `MODEL_STRATEGY_REVISED.md` - Resource-efficient model strategy
- `backend/services/smart_model_router.py` - New intelligent model routing
- `backend/services/llm_service.py` - Updated to use smart routing
- All documentation updated to reflect restructuring

### Current Status
- **Phase 1**: Foundation & Docker Setup ✅ Complete
- **Phase 2**: AI Integration & Testing ⚠️ Needs Complete Restructure
- **Phase 3**: RAG & Vector Memory System 📋 Not Started
- **Phase 4**: RPG System Integration 📋 Not Started

### Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 1 validation with new model strategy
2. Implement proper RAG system with ChromaDB
3. Add RPG mechanics integration
4. Test with actual gameplay scenarios
5. Gradual feature addition based on performance

### Lessons for Future Development
- Always validate hardware requirements before planning
- Build core functionality first, add complexity incrementally
- Test each phase thoroughly before marking complete
- Consider resource constraints in architecture decisions
- Focus on user experience over technical complexity
