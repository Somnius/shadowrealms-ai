## OOC Monitoring System

## Overview

The OOC Monitoring System ensures that players maintain proper roleplay boundaries in Out of Character rooms by using AI to detect and prevent in-character discussions.

## Features

### 1. **OOC Room Protection**
- Every campaign MUST have an OOC (Out of Character) Lobby
- OOC rooms CANNOT be deleted by admins
- OOC rooms are automatically created when a campaign is created
- Missing OOC rooms can be fixed with `backend/fix_missing_ooc_rooms.py`

### 2. **AI-Powered Detection**
The system uses a lightweight AI model (`llama3.2:3b`) to detect in-character content in OOC rooms.

**What is detected as IC (In-Character)?**
- Character actions in first person ("I draw my sword")
- Roleplay actions with asterisks ("*sneaks through shadows*")
- Speaking as your character without clarification
- Describing character actions as if playing them

**What is ALLOWED in OOC?**
- Discussing the game as a player
- Asking rules questions
- Coordinating schedules
- Discussing character plans in third person ("My character should...")
- General chat and banter

### 3. **Warning System**
```
1st Violation → ⚠️  Warning (1/3)
2nd Violation → ⚠️  Warning (2/3)
3rd Violation → ⛔ 24-Hour Ban
```

**Warning Message Example:**
```
⚠️ OOC VIOLATION WARNING (2/3)

Your message appears to contain in-character content. 
The OOC (Out of Character) Lobby is for discussing the game as players, 
not roleplaying as characters.

Please keep in-character discussions to the game locations.

You have 1 warning(s) remaining before a temporary ban is issued.
```

### 4. **Temporary Bans**
- **Duration**: 24 hours
- **Trigger**: 3 OOC violations within 7 days
- **Effect**: User cannot send messages in ANY campaign
- **Message**: Clear explanation of why they were banned and when it expires

**Ban Message Example:**
```
⛔ You are temporarily banned from this campaign.

Reason: Temporary ban for repeated OOC violations in campaign ID 7. 
Please review the OOC room rules: No in-character roleplay in OOC.

Time remaining: 23h 45m

Ban expires: 2025-10-29 14:30 UTC
```

### 5. **Violation Tracking**
- Violations are tracked per user per campaign
- Rolling 7-day window (old violations don't count after 7 days)
- Violations are logged in `ooc_violations` table
- Ban history is stored in `users` table

## Database Schema

### `ooc_violations` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE ooc_violations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    campaign_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    violated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (campaign_id) REFERENCES campaigns(id)
)
```

### `users` Ban Fields
```sql
ban_type TEXT DEFAULT NULL,          -- 'temp' or 'permanent'
ban_until TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL,    -- When ban expires
ban_reason TEXT DEFAULT NULL,        -- Why user was banned
banned_by INTEGER DEFAULT NULL,      -- Admin who issued ban
banned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL     -- When ban was issued
```

## Implementation

### Backend Components

**1. `backend/services/ooc_monitor.py`**
- Core OOC monitoring logic
- AI-powered IC content detection
- Warning and ban management
- Violation tracking

**2. `backend/routes/messages.py`**
- Integrated OOC checking before saving messages
- Returns OOC warnings in API response
- Blocks banned users from sending messages

**3. `backend/fix_missing_ooc_rooms.py`**
- Utility script to create OOC rooms for campaigns that don't have them
- Should be run when adding this feature to existing campaigns

### API Integration

**Message Endpoint**: `POST /api/campaigns/{campaign_id}/locations/{location_id}`

**Response with OOC Warning:**
```json
{
  "message": "Message saved successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "content": "My character draws his sword",
    "role": "user",
    ...
  },
  "ooc_warning": "⚠️ OOC VIOLATION WARNING (1/3)\\n\\nYour message appears to contain in-character content..."
}
```

**Response when Banned:**
```json
{
  "error": "OOC violation - temporarily banned",
  "warning": "⚠️ OOC VIOLATION - TEMPORARY BAN ISSUED\\n\\n...",
  "violation": true
}
```
Status Code: `403 Forbidden`

### Frontend Integration

**1. Display OOC Warnings**
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/campaigns/${campaignId}/locations/${locationId}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ content: message })
});

const data = await response.json();

if (data.ooc_warning) {
  // Display warning prominently to user
  showModal({
    title: '⚠️ OOC Violation Warning',
    message: data.ooc_warning,
    type: 'warning'
  });
}
```

**2. Handle Bans**
```javascript
if (response.status === 403 && data.violation) {
  // User has been banned
  showModal({
    title: '⛔ Temporarily Banned',
    message: data.warning,
    type: 'error'
  });
  
  // Optionally redirect user out of chat
  navigateToDashboard();
}
```

## Configuration

### Tuning Parameters

In `backend/services/ooc_monitor.py`:

```python
class OOCMonitor:
    def __init__(self, llm_service: LLMService):
        self.llm_service = llm_service
        self.warning_threshold = 3  # Change number of warnings before ban
        self.ban_duration_hours = 24  # Change ban duration
```

### AI Model Configuration

The OOC monitor uses a fast, lightweight model for detection:

```python
config = {
    'model': 'llama3.2:3b',  # Fast detection model
    'temperature': 0.3,       # Low for consistent detection
    'max_tokens': 100,
    'task_type': 'moderation'
}
```

**Why llama3.2:3b?**
- Fast response time (<1 second)
- Good at classification tasks
- Low GPU usage
- Consistent results with low temperature

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Create a test campaign** with OOC room
2. **Send IC messages in OOC**:
   - "I draw my sword and attack!"
   - "*sneaks through the shadows*"
   - "My vampire feeds on the mortal"

3. **Verify warnings** appear after each violation
4. **Verify ban** triggers after 3rd violation
5. **Verify ban expires** after 24 hours

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Check all campaigns have OOC rooms
cd /home/lef/dev/shadowrealms-ai_dev/shadowrealms-ai
docker compose exec backend python3 /app/fix_missing_ooc_rooms.py

# Run OOC monitoring tests
docker compose exec backend python3 /app/tests/test_ooc_monitor.py
```

## Monitoring

### Check OOC Violations

```sql
-- Recent violations
SELECT 
    u.username,
    c.name as campaign,
    COUNT(*) as violations,
    MAX(ov.violated_at) as last_violation
FROM ooc_violations ov
JOIN users u ON ov.user_id = u.id
JOIN campaigns c ON ov.campaign_id = c.id
WHERE ov.violated_at > datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY ov.user_id, ov.campaign_id
ORDER BY violations DESC;

-- Currently banned users
SELECT 
    id, username, ban_until, ban_reason
FROM users
WHERE ban_until IS NOT NULL
AND ban_until > datetime('now');
```

### Logs

OOC violations are logged with:
```
⚠️  OOC violation by user {user_id} in campaign {campaign_id}. Warning count: {count}
✅ Issued {ban_duration}h temp ban to user {user_id} for OOC violations
```

## Admin Override

Admins can manually clear bans:

```sql
-- Clear a specific user's ban
UPDATE users
SET ban_until = NULL, ban_reason = NULL
WHERE id = ?;

-- Clear all expired bans
UPDATE users
SET ban_until = NULL, ban_reason = NULL
WHERE ban_until < datetime('now');
```

## Edge Cases

### 1. AI Service Unavailable
- **Behavior**: Fail open - don't block legitimate messages
- **Logged**: `⚠️  Error checking OOC violation: {error}`

### 2. False Positives
- Messages discussing character actions in third person should be allowed
- "My character should investigate the temple" → ALLOWED
- "I investigate the temple" → VIOLATION

### 3. Multiple Campaigns
- Violations are tracked PER CAMPAIGN
- A user can be banned in one campaign but not another
- Future enhancement: global bans across all campaigns

### 4. Ban Expiry
- Bans are checked on every message attempt
- Expired bans are automatically cleared
- No manual intervention needed

## Philosophy

The OOC monitoring system embodies the **"Quality Over Speed"** principle:

- **AI Detection** ensures accurate violation detection
- **Warning System** gives players a chance to learn the rules
- **Temporary Bans** are educational, not punitive
- **Clear Messages** explain what went wrong and how to fix it
- **Automatic Cleanup** prevents accumulation of old violations

The goal is to **maintain roleplay boundaries** while being **fair and educational** to players.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable thresholds per campaign** (some campaigns may want stricter rules)
2. **Admin dashboard** to view violations and manage bans
3. **Appeal system** for disputed bans
4. **Global ban list** for severe repeat offenders
5. **Whitelist phrases** that admins mark as acceptable
6. **AI training** on campaign-specific examples

## AI Memory Cleanup

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive AI memory cleanup system that ensures deleted locations and campaigns are properly removed from **all** memory systems, preventing AI confusion and data conflicts.

## The Problem

When locations or campaigns are deleted, their data exists in **two places**:

1. **SQLite Database** (primary storage)
2. **ChromaDB Vector Store** (AI semantic memory)

Without proper cleanup, the AI would continue to "remember" deleted content through vector embeddings, causing:

- 🔴 Conflicting information (AI references deleted locations)
- 🔴 Confusion in responses (mixing old and new data)
- 🔴 Memory bloat (orphaned embeddings)
- 🔴 Inconsistent behavior (context mismatch)

## The Solution

### **Full AI Memory Cleanup on Deletion**

When a location or campaign is deleted, the system now:

1. ✅ **Soft-deletes** the location (`is_active = 0`)
2. ✅ **Purges ChromaDB embeddings** (semantic memory)
3. ✅ **Creates audit trail** (who deleted, when, what)
4. ✅ **Filters deleted locations** from all AI queries
5. ✅ **Cascades to related data** (messages, connections, etc.)

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Location Deletion (`backend/routes/locations.py`)

```python
@locations_bp.route('/locations/<int:location_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_location(location_id):
    """Delete location with AI memory cleanup and audit trail"""
```

**What it does:**

1. **Retrieves location details** (name, type, description)
2. **Counts affected messages** for audit
3. **Creates audit log entry** in `location_deletion_log` table
4. **Cleans ChromaDB** - deletes all message embeddings for this location
5. **Soft-deletes location** - sets `is_active = 0`
6. **Exits characters** from this location (moves to OOC)
7. **Returns detailed audit info** to frontend

**Example Log Output:**

```
🗑️ Deleting location 5 (Ancient Temple) - 23 messages will be removed
✅ Purged 23 message embeddings from AI memory (ChromaDB)
✅ Location 5 (Ancient Temple) deleted successfully:
   • Soft-deleted from active locations
   • 23 messages CASCADE deleted from SQL
   • Message embeddings purged from ChromaDB
   • Audit log created (deleted by user 1)
   • AI memory cleaned - no conflicts will occur
```

---

### 2. Campaign Deletion (`backend/routes/campaigns.py`)

```python
def delete_campaign(campaign_id):
    """Delete campaign with full AI memory cleanup"""
```

**What it does:**

1. **Counts all locations and messages** for audit
2. **Purges ALL message embeddings** for this campaign from ChromaDB
3. **Hard-deletes campaign** from SQL (CASCADE handles rest)
4. **Returns detailed audit info**

**Example Log Output:**

```
🗑️ Deleting campaign 3 (Ashes of the Aegean):
   • 7 locations
   • 142 messages
✅ Purged 142 message embeddings from AI memory
✅ Campaign 3 (Ashes of the Aegean) fully deleted:
   • SQL data removed (CASCADE)
   • ChromaDB embeddings purged
   • AI memory cleaned - no orphaned data
```

---

### 3. Audit Trail (`location_deletion_log` table)

**Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE location_deletion_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    location_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    campaign_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    location_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    location_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    location_description TEXT,
    deleted_by INTEGER NOT NULL,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (campaign_id) REFERENCES campaigns (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (deleted_by) REFERENCES users (id)
)
```

**What's logged:**

- ✅ Original location details (name, type, description)
- ✅ Who deleted it (`deleted_by`)
- ✅ When it was deleted (`deleted_at`)
- ✅ How many messages were removed (`message_count`)
- ✅ Which campaign it belonged to

**Use cases:**

- Audit queries ("Who deleted the tavern?")
- Recovery information (if needed)
- Usage statistics
- Admin oversight

---

### 4. AI Context Filtering

All AI context retrieval functions now explicitly filter out soft-deleted locations:

**Before:**

```python
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT id, name, type, description
    FROM locations
    WHERE id = ? AND campaign_id = ?
""", (location_id, campaign_id))
```

**After:**

```python
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT id, name, type, description
    FROM locations
    WHERE id = ? AND campaign_id = ? AND is_active = 1
""", (location_id, campaign_id))
```

**Functions updated:**

- ✅ `get_location_context()` - Location details for AI
- ✅ `get_connected_locations()` - Location connections
- ✅ All frontend location queries

---

## ChromaDB Embedding ID Format

**Format:** `msg_{message_id}_{campaign_id}`

**Examples:**

- `msg_123_5` - Message 123 in campaign 5
- `msg_456_5` - Message 456 in campaign 5

**Why this format:**

- Easy to delete by pattern (all messages in a campaign)
- Campaign ID included for disambiguation
- Consistent with message table IDs

**Deletion Logic:**

```python
# Get all message IDs for this location
cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM messages WHERE location_id = ?", (location_id,))
message_ids = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

# Generate ChromaDB IDs
embedding_ids = [f"msg_{msg_id}_{campaign_id}" for msg_id in message_ids]

# Delete from ChromaDB
collection.delete(ids=embedding_ids)
```

---

## Database Schema Changes

### New Table: `location_deletion_log`

**Purpose:** Audit trail for deleted locations

**Key Features:**

- Stores original location details
- Tracks who deleted and when
- Counts affected messages
- Survives campaign deletion (until campaign CASCADE)

**Index:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_deletion_log_campaign 
ON location_deletion_log(campaign_id, deleted_at DESC)
```

Optimized for: "Show me all deletions in this campaign"

---

## API Response Format

### Location Deletion Response

```json
{
  "message": "Location deleted successfully",
  "audit": {
    "location_name": "Ancient Temple",
    "messages_removed": 23,
    "deleted_by": 1,
    "ai_memory_cleaned": true
  }
}
```

### Campaign Deletion Response

```json
{
  "message": "Campaign deleted successfully",
  "campaign_id": 3,
  "audit": {
    "campaign_name": "Ashes of the Aegean",
    "locations_removed": 7,
    "messages_removed": 142,
    "ai_memory_cleaned": true
  }
}
```

---

## Error Handling

### ChromaDB Cleanup Failures

If ChromaDB cleanup fails (e.g., service down), it's **non-critical**:

```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"⚠️ ChromaDB cleanup failed (non-critical): {e}")
```

**Why non-critical:**

- SQL deletion still succeeds
- Location is still soft-deleted
- Next ChromaDB garbage collection will clean up orphans
- AI won't fetch deleted location (filtered by `is_active = 1`)

### SQL Transaction Safety

All operations are wrapped in transactions:

```python
try:
    # ... deletion logic ...
    conn.commit()
except Exception as e:
    conn.rollback()
    logger.error(f"❌ Error deleting: {e}")
    return jsonify({'error': 'Failed to delete'}), 500
```

---

## Testing the System

### Test Location Deletion

1. Create a campaign with AI-suggested locations
2. Send messages in one of the locations
3. Delete that location
4. Check backend logs for:
   - ✅ Message count
   - ✅ ChromaDB purge confirmation
   - ✅ Audit log creation
5. Try to fetch that location from AI context (should fail)
6. Create new location with similar name (should work without conflicts)

### Test Campaign Deletion

1. Create a campaign with multiple locations
2. Send messages in several locations
3. Delete the campaign
4. Check backend logs for:
   - ✅ Location count
   - ✅ Message count
   - ✅ ChromaDB purge confirmation
5. Verify SQL CASCADE deleted all related data
6. Create new campaign with same name (should work without conflicts)

### Test AI Context Filtering

1. Soft-delete a location (set `is_active = 0` manually)
2. Try to get AI context for that location
3. AI should return "Unknown Location"
4. Verify deleted location doesn't appear in connected locations

---

## Performance Considerations

### ChromaDB Batch Deletions

For large campaigns (1000+ messages):

```python
# Efficient: Delete in one batch
embedding_ids = [f"msg_{msg_id}_{campaign_id}" for msg_id in message_ids]
collection.delete(ids=embedding_ids)  # Single operation
```

**Not:**

```python
# Inefficient: Delete one by one
for msg_id in message_ids:
    collection.delete(ids=[f"msg_{msg_id}_{campaign_id}"])
```

### SQL CASCADE

SQLite's `ON DELETE CASCADE` automatically handles:

- ✅ Messages when location deleted
- ✅ All location data when campaign deleted
- ✅ Character locations
- ✅ Location connections
- ✅ Dice rolls
- ✅ Combat encounters

**No manual cleanup needed in SQL.**

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Useful Log Patterns

**Location deletion:**

```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep "Deleting location"
docker compose logs backend | grep "Purged.*embeddings"
```

**Campaign deletion:**

```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep "Deleting campaign"
docker compose logs backend | grep "AI memory cleaned"
```

### Audit Queries

**View deletion history:**

```sql
SELECT 
    location_name, 
    location_type, 
    deleted_at, 
    message_count, 
    deleted_by
FROM location_deletion_log
WHERE campaign_id = ?
ORDER BY deleted_at DESC;
```

**Count deletions per campaign:**

```sql
SELECT 
    campaign_id, 
    COUNT(*) as deletions,
    SUM(message_count) as total_messages_removed
FROM location_deletion_log
GROUP BY campaign_id;
```

---

## Quality Philosophy

### "Quality Over Speed" Applied

This implementation follows the project's core principle:

1. **No shortcuts** - Full cleanup, not just SQL delete
2. **User-friendly feedback** - Detailed audit info returned
3. **Comprehensive logging** - Every step logged for debugging
4. **Error resilience** - ChromaDB failure doesn't break deletion
5. **Future-proof** - Soft delete allows recovery if needed
6. **AI integrity** - Explicit filtering in all queries

### Why This Matters

Without proper AI memory cleanup:

- ❌ "The ancient temple" would appear in AI responses after deletion
- ❌ Connected locations would reference non-existent places
- ❌ Semantic search would return messages from deleted locations
- ❌ AI would be confused by conflicting context

With proper cleanup:

- ✅ AI has clean, consistent context
- ✅ No orphaned data in vector store
- ✅ Audit trail for accountability
- ✅ Safe to reuse location names

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Soft Delete for Campaigns** - Allow campaign recovery within X days
2. **Garbage Collection** - Periodic ChromaDB orphan cleanup
3. **Deletion Webhooks** - Notify admins of major deletions
4. **Batch Deletion** - Delete multiple locations at once
5. **Undelete Function** - Restore soft-deleted locations (within time window)

### ChromaDB Collection Strategies

Currently: One `message_memory` collection for all campaigns

**Alternative:** One collection per campaign

**Pros:**

- Easier to delete entire campaign (drop collection)
- Better isolation between campaigns

**Cons:**

- ChromaDB has collection limits
- Semantic search across campaigns harder

**Current approach is correct for this use case.**

## AI Memory Implementation

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** 🚀 IN PROGRESS  
**Approach:** Phased implementation with testing at each step

---

## 🎯 Complete Vision

AI that remembers and understands:
- ✅ All conversation history (recent + semantic search)
- ✅ Location context (where, what's there, atmosphere)
- ✅ Character information (who's talking, their background)
- ✅ NPC interactions (who said what, relationships)
- ✅ Character-to-Character interactions
- ✅ Character-to-NPC interactions
- ✅ NPC-to-NPC interactions
- ✅ Location-to-Location relationships (connected areas)
- ✅ Combat context (ongoing fights, initiative, wounds)
- ✅ World data (campaign events, lore, rules)

---

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### **PHASE 1: Foundation - Message History & Location Context** ⏱️ 1.5 hours
**Goal:** AI sees recent messages and knows where conversation happens

#### Step 1.1: Create Location Context Function (20 min)
- Function: `get_location_context(location_id, campaign_id)`
- Fetches: location name, type, description
- Returns: formatted location info

#### Step 1.2: Create Message History Function (20 min)
- Function: `get_recent_messages(location_id, campaign_id, limit=15)`
- Fetches: last N messages from this location
- Formats: chronological conversation history
- Includes: username, timestamp, role

#### Step 1.3: Update AI Response Functions (30 min)
- Modify: `generate_efficient_response()`
- Modify: `generate_balanced_response()`
- Modify: `generate_full_response()`
- Add: location_id parameter
- Integrate: location context + message history into prompt

#### Step 1.4: Update Frontend to Pass location_id (20 min)
- Modify: `handleSendMessage()` in SimpleApp.js
- Pass: `location: currentLocation.id` to AI API

#### Step 1.5: Test Phase 1 (10 min)
- Send messages in different locations
- Verify AI remembers recent conversation
- Verify AI knows current location

**Output:** AI can recall recent messages and knows location context

---

### **PHASE 2: Character Awareness** ⏱️ 1 hour
**Goal:** AI knows who's talking and their background

#### Step 2.1: Create Character Context Function (25 min)
- Function: `get_character_context(user_id, campaign_id)`
- Fetches: character name, system_type, attributes, skills, background
- Returns: formatted character info

#### Step 2.2: Integrate Character Context into AI Prompt (20 min)
- Modify: AI response functions
- Add: character data to prompt
- Format: "Character: [name], Clan: [clan], Background: [summary]"

#### Step 2.3: Character-Aware Responses (15 min)
- Update: system prompts to be character-aware
- Example: "Respond as if speaking to [character name], a [clan] vampire..."

**Output:** AI addresses player by character name, considers character background

---

### **PHASE 3: NPC System & Interactions** ⏱️ 1.5 hours
**Goal:** Track NPCs per location, their statements, and interactions

#### Step 3.1: Create NPCs Table (20 min)
- Migration: Add `npcs` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE npcs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    campaign_id INTEGER,
    location_id INTEGER,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT,  -- 'bartender', 'guard', 'vampire', etc.
    description TEXT,
    personality TEXT,
    faction TEXT,
    created_by INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

#### Step 3.2: Create NPC_Messages Table (20 min)
- Migration: Add `npc_messages` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE npc_messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    npc_id INTEGER,
    location_id INTEGER,
    campaign_id INTEGER,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    context TEXT,  -- What prompted this
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (npc_id) REFERENCES npcs(id)
)
```

#### Step 3.3: NPC Context Function (25 min)
- Function: `get_location_npcs(location_id)`
- Returns: NPCs present at location
- Function: `get_npc_history(npc_id, limit=5)`
- Returns: Recent NPC statements/actions

#### Step 3.4: Track NPC Interactions in Messages (25 min)
- Add: `npc_id` reference to messages table (optional)
- Function: `store_npc_interaction(npc_id, message, context)`
- Tracks: What NPCs said/did based on AI responses

**Output:** AI knows NPCs at location, remembers what they said

---

### **PHASE 4: Semantic Search (RAG Integration)** ⏱️ 1 hour
**Goal:** AI can search ALL past messages, not just recent

#### Step 4.1: Embed Messages into ChromaDB (30 min)
- Function: `embed_message(message_id, content, metadata)`
- Called: When message is saved to database
- Metadata: {campaign_id, location_id, user_id, timestamp}

#### Step 4.2: Semantic Message Retrieval (20 min)
- Function: `retrieve_relevant_messages(query, location_id, limit=5)`
- Uses: RAG service to search message embeddings
- Returns: Most relevant past messages

#### Step 4.3: Integrate Semantic Search into AI Prompt (10 min)
- Add: Relevant historical messages to context
- Format: "Relevant Past Context: [semantic results]"

**Output:** AI can recall details from days/weeks ago

---

### **PHASE 5: Combat & Conflict Context** ⏱️ 1 hour
**Goal:** AI understands ongoing fights, initiative, wounds

#### Step 5.1: Create Combat_Encounters Table (20 min)
```sql
CREATE TABLE combat_encounters (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    campaign_id INTEGER,
    location_id INTEGER,
    status TEXT,  -- 'active', 'resolved'
    initiative_order TEXT,  -- JSON array
    round_number INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

#### Step 5.2: Create Combat_Participants Table (20 min)
```sql
CREATE TABLE combat_participants (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    encounter_id INTEGER,
    character_id INTEGER,
    npc_id INTEGER,
    current_hp INTEGER,
    max_hp INTEGER,
    conditions TEXT,  -- JSON array
    initiative INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (encounter_id) REFERENCES combat_encounters(id)
)
```

#### Step 5.3: Combat Context Function (20 min)
- Function: `get_active_combat(location_id)`
- Returns: Current fight status if active
- Includes: Participants, HP, initiative order, conditions

**Output:** AI knows about ongoing combat, adjusts responses

---

### **PHASE 6: Relationship & Interaction Tracking** ⏱️ 45 min
**Goal:** Track character-character, character-NPC, NPC-NPC relationships

#### Step 6.1: Create Relationships Table (20 min)
```sql
CREATE TABLE relationships (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    campaign_id INTEGER,
    entity1_type TEXT,  -- 'character' or 'npc'
    entity1_id INTEGER,
    entity2_type TEXT,
    entity2_id INTEGER,
    relationship_type TEXT,  -- 'ally', 'enemy', 'neutral', 'lover', etc.
    strength INTEGER,  -- -10 to +10
    notes TEXT,
    last_interaction TIMESTAMP
)
```

#### Step 6.2: Relationship Context Function (25 min)
- Function: `get_entity_relationships(entity_type, entity_id)`
- Returns: All relationships for character/NPC
- Function: `update_relationship(entity1, entity2, change)`
- Updates: Relationship based on interactions

**Output:** AI knows who likes/hates whom, adjusts dialogue

---

### **PHASE 7: Location Connections & World Context** ⏱️ 30 min
**Goal:** AI understands connected locations and campaign world

#### Step 7.1: Add Location Connections (15 min)
```sql
CREATE TABLE location_connections (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    location1_id INTEGER,
    location2_id INTEGER,
    connection_type TEXT,  -- 'door', 'path', 'teleport', 'hidden'
    description TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (location1_id) REFERENCES locations(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (location2_id) REFERENCES locations(id)
)
```

#### Step 7.2: World Context Function (15 min)
- Function: `get_world_context(campaign_id)`
- Fetches: Recent campaign events, active plots
- Returns: Current state of the world

**Output:** AI knows connected areas, ongoing campaign events

---

### **PHASE 8: Context Manager & Token Optimization** ⏱️ 45 min
**Goal:** Smart context assembly, stay within token limits

#### Step 8.1: Create Context Manager Class (30 min)
- Class: `AIContextManager`
- Method: `build_context(message, location_id, user_id, campaign_id)`
- Logic: Prioritize context based on relevance
- Token counting: Ensure doesn't exceed LLM limits
- Prioritization:
  1. Current location & immediate messages (always include)
  2. Active combat (if any)
  3. NPCs present
  4. Character info
  5. Relevant semantic history
  6. Relationships (if mentioned)
  7. World events

#### Step 8.2: Integrate Context Manager (15 min)
- Replace: Manual context building
- Use: AIContextManager.build_context()
- Result: Optimized, intelligent context

**Output:** AI has all relevant context without exceeding limits

---

### **PHASE 9: Testing & Refinement** ⏱️ 30 min
**Goal:** Verify everything works together

#### Test Scenarios:
1. ✅ Multi-location conversation continuity
2. ✅ Character recognition and appropriate responses
3. ✅ NPC interaction memory
4. ✅ Combat situation awareness
5. ✅ Relationship-aware dialogue
6. ✅ Semantic recall of old events

## AI Context & Memory Proposal

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Issue:** AI doesn't remember previous discussions when responding  
**Goal:** Make AI aware of location history, characters, and world data

---

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### What's Already Working ✅
1. **Messages saved to database** - All conversations stored per location
2. **RAG Service** - ChromaDB for semantic search (retrieve_memories)
3. **AI Memory Table** - Stores conversation summaries
4. **Campaign Context** - AI gets basic campaign info (name, description, game system)

### What's Missing ❌
1. **No message history in AI prompts** - AI doesn't see previous messages
2. **No location-specific context** - AI doesn't know where the conversation is happening
3. **No character awareness** - AI doesn't know who's talking
4. **No world data retrieval** - AI can't reference location details

---

## 💡 Proposed Solutions (Choose Your Approach)

### **Option A: Simple Context Window (Recommended for Start)**
**Complexity:** 🟢 Low  
**Performance:** 🟢 Fast  
**Memory:** 🟢 Efficient  

#### How It Works
When user sends a message:
1. Fetch **last N messages** from this location (e.g., last 10-20)
2. Add messages to AI prompt as "conversation history"
3. Include location name and description
4. Send to AI with full context

#### Example Prompt Structure
```
System: You are an AI storyteller for a Vampire: The Masquerade game.

Campaign: The Debt of Blood
Location: The Gathering Place (tavern) - A common meeting location for the characters.
Game System: Vampire: The Masquerade

Recent Conversation History:
[10 minutes ago] User (adminator): "I enter the tavern and look around."
[9 minutes ago] AI: "The tavern is dimly lit, with the smell of old blood..."
[5 minutes ago] User (adminator): "I approach the bartender."

Current Message: "What can you tell me about the local prince?"
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Simple to implement (1-2 hours)
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No complex infrastructure
- ✅ Easy to debug
- ✅ Predictable behavior

#### Cons
- ⚠️ Limited to recent messages only (no long-term memory)
- ⚠️ Sends same history every time (slight inefficiency)
- ⚠️ Can't search old conversations semantically

#### Implementation Steps
1. Modify `generate_*_response()` functions
2. Add `get_location_context(location_id)` function
3. Fetch last N messages from database
4. Format as conversation history
5. Add to AI prompt

---

### **Option B: RAG-Enhanced Context (Best Balance)**
**Complexity:** 🟡 Medium  
**Performance:** 🟡 Good  
**Memory:** 🟡 Smart  

#### How It Works
When user sends a message:
1. Use **semantic search** on message history for this location
2. Find the **most relevant past messages** related to current query
3. Fetch location details from database
4. Combine: relevant history + location data + current message
5. Send to AI

#### Example Flow
```
User asks: "What did the bartender tell me about the prince?"

Step 1: Semantic search in messages
  → Finds: "The bartender mentioned the prince is paranoid..."
  → Finds: "Local vampires fear the prince's wrath..."
  
Step 2: Get location context
  → The Gathering Place (tavern)
  → Description: Common meeting location
  → NPCs present: Bartender (Marcus), 3 patrons
  
Step 3: Combine & send to AI
  → Relevant history (semantically matched)
  → Location details
  → Current question
  
AI Response: "As you recall, the bartender Marcus mentioned that the prince..."
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Retrieves **relevant** context, not just recent
- ✅ Can remember details from days ago
- ✅ Semantic understanding (asks "what did he say?" → finds the actual statement)
- ✅ Scales better for long campaigns
- ✅ More natural AI responses

#### Cons
- ⚠️ Requires ChromaDB integration for messages
- ⚠️ Slightly more complex (2-3 hours)
- ⚠️ Need to embed messages into vector database
- ⚠️ Slight delay for semantic search

#### Implementation Steps
1. Store messages in ChromaDB when saved (embed content)
2. Create `retrieve_location_messages(location_id, query)` function
3. Use RAG service to find relevant messages
4. Fetch location details (description, NPCs, etc.)
5. Build enhanced context for AI
6. Add to AI prompt

---

### **Option C: Hybrid Approach (Maximum Quality)**
**Complexity:** 🔴 High  
**Performance:** 🟡 Good but resource-intensive  
**Memory:** 🔴 Most demanding  

#### How It Works
Combines both approaches:
1. **Always include**: Last 5-10 messages (recency)
2. **Semantic search**: Additional relevant messages from history
3. **Location data**: Full details (description, NPCs, items)
4. **Character data**: Who's speaking, their background
5. **World data**: Related lore, rules, campaign events

#### Example Context
```
=== IMMEDIATE CONTEXT ===
Last 5 messages in this location...

=== RELEVANT HISTORY ===
[3 days ago] In this tavern, the bartender warned about...
[1 week ago] You learned that the prince is...

=== LOCATION ===
The Gathering Place
Type: Tavern
Description: ...
NPCs: Marcus (Bartender), suspicious hooded figure
Atmosphere: Tense, vampire politics

=== CHARACTER ===
Player: adminator
Character: Marcus the Ventrue
Clan: Ventrue
Background: Noble lineage, political ambitions
Current Status: Blood pool 7/10, investigating prince

=== WORLD DATA ===
Campaign Setting: Modern Chicago, Camarilla controlled
Recent Events: Prince declared martial law
Key NPCs: Prince Alexandros (paranoid), Sheriff Victoria (ruthless)
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Most intelligent responses
- ✅ AI remembers everything
- ✅ Character-aware roleplay
- ✅ Location-specific details
- ✅ Campaign continuity

#### Cons
- ⚠️ Complex implementation (4-6 hours)
- ⚠️ More tokens = higher latency
- ⚠️ Requires character system integration
- ⚠️ Need to manage context window limits
- ⚠️ Ongoing maintenance

#### Implementation Steps
1. Implement Option B (RAG)
2. Add `get_character_context(user_id, campaign_id)`
3. Add `get_location_details(location_id)`
4. Add `get_world_context(campaign_id)`
5. Create context manager to combine all data
6. Implement token limit checks
7. Prioritize context based on relevance

## 🛠️ Implementation Preview

### What I Would Build (Option A)

**New Function:**
```python
def get_location_context(location_id: int, campaign_id: int, limit: int = 10) -> dict:
    """Get context for a specific location"""
    db = get_db()
    cursor = db.cursor()
    
    # Get location details
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT name, type, description
        FROM locations
        WHERE id = ? AND campaign_id = ?
    """, (location_id, campaign_id))
    location = cursor.fetchone()
    
    # Get recent messages from this location
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT m.content, m.role, m.created_at, u.username
        FROM messages m
        JOIN users u ON m.user_id = u.id
        WHERE m.campaign_id = ? AND m.location_id = ?
        ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
        LIMIT ?
    """, (campaign_id, location_id, limit))
    messages = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # Format conversation history
    history = []
    for msg in reversed(messages):  # Chronological order
        timestamp = format_timestamp(msg['created_at'])
        role = "User" if msg['role'] == 'user' else "AI"
        history.append(f"[{timestamp}] {role} ({msg['username']}): {msg['content']}")
    
    return {
        'location': location,
        'history': '\n'.join(history),
        'message_count': len(messages)
    }
```

**Updated AI Prompt:**
```python
def generate_full_response(message: str, context: dict, campaign_id: int, location_id: int = None) -> str:
    llm_service = get_llm_service()
    
    # Get campaign context
    campaign_context = get_campaign_context(campaign_id)
    
    # Get location context if provided
    location_context = ""
    if location_id:
        loc_data = get_location_context(location_id, campaign_id, limit=10)
        location_context = f"\nLocation: {loc_data['location']['name']} ({loc_data['location']['type']})"
        location_context += f"\nDescription: {loc_data['location']['description']}"
        location_context += f"\n\nRecent Conversation History ({loc_data['message_count']} messages):\n{loc_data['history']}"
    
    # Build enhanced prompt
    llm_context = {
        'system_prompt': f'''You are an AI storyteller for a tabletop RPG.
        
{campaign_context}
{location_context}

Current player message: {message}

Respond as the AI storyteller, taking into account the conversation history and location context.''',
        'campaign_context': campaign_context
    }
    
    llm_config = {
        'max_tokens': 1024,
        'temperature': 0.8,
        'top_p': 0.95
    }
    
    return llm_service.generate_response(message, llm_context, llm_config)
```

- `estimate_tokens(text)` - Rough estimation (1 token ≈ 4 chars)

**Context Priority System:**
1. **CRITICAL** (always included):
   - Campaign basics
   - Character info
   
2. **HIGH** priority:
   - Location context
   - Active combat (if present)
   - Recent message history

3. **MEDIUM** priority:
   - NPCs at location
   - Semantic history (balanced/full only)

4. **LOW** priority:
   - Relationships (full mode only)
   - Connected locations

**Token Budget Management:**
- Max 4000 tokens for context
- Dynamically includes/excludes based on available budget
- Logs what was included for debugging

**Result:** AI has comprehensive context without exceeding token limits

---

### **PHASE 9: Testing & Refinement** ✅

**What was done:**
- All database tables created with proper foreign keys and indexes
- All functions integrated and backend restarted
- Code structured for maintainability
- Error handling in place
- Logging for debugging

User: "What did the bartender tell me about the prince?"
AI: "I don't have information about previous conversations."
```

### **After This System:**

**Efficient Mode:**
```
User: "What did the bartender tell me about the prince?"
AI: "As you recall from 5 minutes ago, Marcus the bartender mentioned 
     that the prince has become paranoid..."
```

**Balanced Mode:**
```
User: "What did the bartender tell me about the prince?"
AI: "Three days ago in this tavern, Marcus warned you that Prince 
     Alexandros has eyes everywhere. He mentioned two vampires who 
     questioned him recently disappeared..."
```

**Full Mode:**
```
User: "What did the bartender tell me about the prince?"
AI: "Viktor, as a Ventrue yourself, you understand the political 
     implications. Three days ago, Marcus the Toreador bartender 
     warned you that Prince Alexandros has become increasingly 
     paranoid since the disappearances. Given your clan's nature 
     and your cautious relationship with the prince (strength: -1), 
     you should tread carefully. The hooded figure in the corner 
     continues watching..."
```

## 🚀 USAGE EXAMPLES

### **For AI to Remember Recent Chat:**
Just talk naturally! The AI automatically:
- Sees last 5-15 messages (depending on mode)
- Knows current location
- Knows your character

### **For AI to Recall Old Events:**
Ask questions like:
- "What did we discuss about vampires last week?"
- "Remind me what happened with the prince?"
- "What did Marcus say about the disappearances?"

The semantic search will find relevant past messages!

### **For NPC Interactions:**
When NPCs are at your location, the AI will:
- Roleplay them with distinct personalities
- Remember their previous statements
- React to your actions in character

### **For Combat:**
When combat is active, the AI:
- Tracks initiative order
- Knows HP and conditions
- Responds appropriately to combat actions
