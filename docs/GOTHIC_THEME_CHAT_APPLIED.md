# 🎮 Gothic Theme Applied to Chat Interface! 🦇

## ✅ COMPLETED: Campaign-Specific Chat Effects

### What Was Implemented:

#### 1. **Auto-Detection System** 🔍
Created `getCampaignTheme()` function that automatically detects campaign type:
```javascript
// Detects based on game_system field:
- "Vampire: The Masquerade" → vampire theme (blood drips)
- "Mage: The Ascension" → mage theme (magic sparkles)
- "Werewolf: The Apocalypse" → werewolf theme (bite marks)
- Everything else → none (clean)
```

#### 2. **Chat Interface Effects** 💬
The main chat area now uses `<GothicBox theme={campaignTheme}>`:
- **Messages area**: Wrapped with gothic decorations
- **Channel header**: Gothic fonts applied
- **Input field**: Crimson Text font
- **Send button**: Cinzel font, clean text

**Effects appear based on selected campaign:**
- Enter a **Vampire** campaign → Blood drips fall from top
- Enter a **Mage** campaign → Purple sparkles float around
- Enter a **Werewolf** campaign → Bite marks pulse in background

#### 3. **Preview Page Enhanced** 👁️
Added **Werewolf campaign card** to Gothic Showcase:
- Shows bite mark effects
- Amber/orange color scheme (#d97706)
- Tribal fury and primal rage theme
- "Join the Pack" button
