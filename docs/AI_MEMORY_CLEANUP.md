# AI Memory Cleanup System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive AI memory cleanup system that ensures deleted locations and campaigns are properly removed from **all** memory systems, preventing AI confusion and data conflicts.

## The Problem

When locations or campaigns are deleted, their data exists in **two places**:

1. **SQLite Database** (primary storage)
2. **ChromaDB Vector Store** (AI semantic memory)

Without proper cleanup, the AI would continue to "remember" deleted content through vector embeddings, causing:

- üî¥ Conflicting information (AI references deleted locations)
- üî¥ Confusion in responses (mixing old and new data)
- üî¥ Memory bloat (orphaned embeddings)
- üî¥ Inconsistent behavior (context mismatch)

## The Solution

### **Full AI Memory Cleanup on Deletion**

When a location or campaign is deleted, the system now:

1. ‚úÖ **Soft-deletes** the location (`is_active = 0`)
2. ‚úÖ **Purges ChromaDB embeddings** (semantic memory)
3. ‚úÖ **Creates audit trail** (who deleted, when, what)
4. ‚úÖ **Filters deleted locations** from all AI queries
5. ‚úÖ **Cascades to related data** (messages, connections, etc.)

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Location Deletion (`backend/routes/locations.py`)

```python
@locations_bp.route('/locations/<int:location_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_location(location_id):
    """Delete location with AI memory cleanup and audit trail"""
```

**What it does:**

1. **Retrieves location details** (name, type, description)
2. **Counts affected messages** for audit
3. **Creates audit log entry** in `location_deletion_log` table
4. **Cleans ChromaDB** - deletes all message embeddings for this location
5. **Soft-deletes location** - sets `is_active = 0`
6. **Exits characters** from this location (moves to OOC)
7. **Returns detailed audit info** to frontend

**Example Log Output:**

```
üóëÔ∏è Deleting location 5 (Ancient Temple) - 23 messages will be removed
‚úÖ Purged 23 message embeddings from AI memory (ChromaDB)
‚úÖ Location 5 (Ancient Temple) deleted successfully:
   ‚Ä¢ Soft-deleted from active locations
   ‚Ä¢ 23 messages CASCADE deleted from SQL
   ‚Ä¢ Message embeddings purged from ChromaDB
   ‚Ä¢ Audit log created (deleted by user 1)
   ‚Ä¢ AI memory cleaned - no conflicts will occur
```

---

### 2. Campaign Deletion (`backend/routes/campaigns.py`)

```python
def delete_campaign(campaign_id):
    """Delete campaign with full AI memory cleanup"""
```

**What it does:**

1. **Counts all locations and messages** for audit
2. **Purges ALL message embeddings** for this campaign from ChromaDB
3. **Hard-deletes campaign** from SQL (CASCADE handles rest)
4. **Returns detailed audit info**

**Example Log Output:**

```
üóëÔ∏è Deleting campaign 3 (Ashes of the Aegean):
   ‚Ä¢ 7 locations
   ‚Ä¢ 142 messages
‚úÖ Purged 142 message embeddings from AI memory
‚úÖ Campaign 3 (Ashes of the Aegean) fully deleted:
   ‚Ä¢ SQL data removed (CASCADE)
   ‚Ä¢ ChromaDB embeddings purged
   ‚Ä¢ AI memory cleaned - no orphaned data
```

---

### 3. Audit Trail (`location_deletion_log` table)

**Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE location_deletion_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    location_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    campaign_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    location_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    location_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    location_description TEXT,
    deleted_by INTEGER NOT NULL,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (campaign_id) REFERENCES campaigns (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (deleted_by) REFERENCES users (id)
)
```

**What's logged:**

- ‚úÖ Original location details (name, type, description)
- ‚úÖ Who deleted it (`deleted_by`)
- ‚úÖ When it was deleted (`deleted_at`)
- ‚úÖ How many messages were removed (`message_count`)
- ‚úÖ Which campaign it belonged to

**Use cases:**

- Audit queries ("Who deleted the tavern?")
- Recovery information (if needed)
- Usage statistics
- Admin oversight

---

### 4. AI Context Filtering

All AI context retrieval functions now explicitly filter out soft-deleted locations:

**Before:**

```python
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT id, name, type, description
    FROM locations
    WHERE id = ? AND campaign_id = ?
""", (location_id, campaign_id))
```

**After:**

```python
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT id, name, type, description
    FROM locations
    WHERE id = ? AND campaign_id = ? AND is_active = 1
""", (location_id, campaign_id))
```

**Functions updated:**

- ‚úÖ `get_location_context()` - Location details for AI
- ‚úÖ `get_connected_locations()` - Location connections
- ‚úÖ All frontend location queries

---

## ChromaDB Embedding ID Format

**Format:** `msg_{message_id}_{campaign_id}`

**Examples:**

- `msg_123_5` - Message 123 in campaign 5
- `msg_456_5` - Message 456 in campaign 5

**Why this format:**

- Easy to delete by pattern (all messages in a campaign)
- Campaign ID included for disambiguation
- Consistent with message table IDs

**Deletion Logic:**

```python
# Get all message IDs for this location
cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM messages WHERE location_id = ?", (location_id,))
message_ids = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

# Generate ChromaDB IDs
embedding_ids = [f"msg_{msg_id}_{campaign_id}" for msg_id in message_ids]

# Delete from ChromaDB
collection.delete(ids=embedding_ids)
```

---

## Database Schema Changes

### New Table: `location_deletion_log`

**Purpose:** Audit trail for deleted locations

**Key Features:**

- Stores original location details
- Tracks who deleted and when
- Counts affected messages
- Survives campaign deletion (until campaign CASCADE)

**Index:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_deletion_log_campaign 
ON location_deletion_log(campaign_id, deleted_at DESC)
```

Optimized for: "Show me all deletions in this campaign"

## API Response Format

### Location Deletion Response

```json
{
  "message": "Location deleted successfully",
  "audit": {
    "location_name": "Ancient Temple",
    "messages_removed": 23,
    "deleted_by": 1,
    "ai_memory_cleaned": true
  }
}
```

### Campaign Deletion Response

```json
{
  "message": "Campaign deleted successfully",
  "campaign_id": 3,
  "audit": {
    "campaign_name": "Ashes of the Aegean",
    "locations_removed": 7,
    "messages_removed": 142,
    "ai_memory_cleaned": true
  }
}
```

---

## Error Handling

### ChromaDB Cleanup Failures

If ChromaDB cleanup fails (e.g., service down), it's **non-critical**:

```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è ChromaDB cleanup failed (non-critical): {e}")
```

**Why non-critical:**

- SQL deletion still succeeds
- Location is still soft-deleted
- Next ChromaDB garbage collection will clean up orphans
- AI won't fetch deleted location (filtered by `is_active = 1`)

### SQL Transaction Safety

All operations are wrapped in transactions:

```python
try:
    # ... deletion logic ...
    conn.commit()
except Exception as e:
    conn.rollback()
    logger.error(f"‚ùå Error deleting: {e}")
    return jsonify({'error': 'Failed to delete'}), 500
```

## Testing the System

### Test Location Deletion

1. Create a campaign with AI-suggested locations
2. Send messages in one of the locations
3. Delete that location
4. Check backend logs for:
   - ‚úÖ Message count
   - ‚úÖ ChromaDB purge confirmation
   - ‚úÖ Audit log creation
5. Try to fetch that location from AI context (should fail)
6. Create new location with similar name (should work without conflicts)

### Test Campaign Deletion

1. Create a campaign with multiple locations
2. Send messages in several locations
3. Delete the campaign
4. Check backend logs for:
   - ‚úÖ Location count
   - ‚úÖ Message count
   - ‚úÖ ChromaDB purge confirmation
5. Verify SQL CASCADE deleted all related data
6. Create new campaign with same name (should work without conflicts)

### Test AI Context Filtering

1. Soft-delete a location (set `is_active = 0` manually)
2. Try to get AI context for that location
3. AI should return "Unknown Location"
4. Verify deleted location doesn't appear in connected locations

---

## Performance Considerations

### ChromaDB Batch Deletions

For large campaigns (1000+ messages):

```python
# Efficient: Delete in one batch
embedding_ids = [f"msg_{msg_id}_{campaign_id}" for msg_id in message_ids]
collection.delete(ids=embedding_ids)  # Single operation
```

**Not:**

```python
# Inefficient: Delete one by one
for msg_id in message_ids:
    collection.delete(ids=[f"msg_{msg_id}_{campaign_id}"])
```

### SQL CASCADE

SQLite's `ON DELETE CASCADE` automatically handles:

- ‚úÖ Messages when location deleted
- ‚úÖ All location data when campaign deleted
- ‚úÖ Character locations
- ‚úÖ Location connections
- ‚úÖ Dice rolls
- ‚úÖ Combat encounters

**No manual cleanup needed in SQL.**

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Useful Log Patterns

**Location deletion:**

```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep "Deleting location"
docker compose logs backend | grep "Purged.*embeddings"
```

**Campaign deletion:**

```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep "Deleting campaign"
docker compose logs backend | grep "AI memory cleaned"
```

### Audit Queries

**View deletion history:**

```sql
SELECT 
    location_name, 
    location_type, 
    deleted_at, 
    message_count, 
    deleted_by
FROM location_deletion_log
WHERE campaign_id = ?
ORDER BY deleted_at DESC;
```

**Count deletions per campaign:**

```sql
SELECT 
    campaign_id, 
    COUNT(*) as deletions,
    SUM(message_count) as total_messages_removed
FROM location_deletion_log
GROUP BY campaign_id;
```

## Quality Philosophy

### "Quality Over Speed" Applied

This implementation follows the project's core principle:

1. **No shortcuts** - Full cleanup, not just SQL delete
2. **User-friendly feedback** - Detailed audit info returned
3. **Comprehensive logging** - Every step logged for debugging
4. **Error resilience** - ChromaDB failure doesn't break deletion
5. **Future-proof** - Soft delete allows recovery if needed
6. **AI integrity** - Explicit filtering in all queries

### Why This Matters

Without proper AI memory cleanup:

- ‚ùå "The ancient temple" would appear in AI responses after deletion
- ‚ùå Connected locations would reference non-existent places
- ‚ùå Semantic search would return messages from deleted locations
- ‚ùå AI would be confused by conflicting context

With proper cleanup:

- ‚úÖ AI has clean, consistent context
- ‚úÖ No orphaned data in vector store
- ‚úÖ Audit trail for accountability
- ‚úÖ Safe to reuse location names

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Soft Delete for Campaigns** - Allow campaign recovery within X days
2. **Garbage Collection** - Periodic ChromaDB orphan cleanup
3. **Deletion Webhooks** - Notify admins of major deletions
4. **Batch Deletion** - Delete multiple locations at once
5. **Undelete Function** - Restore soft-deleted locations (within time window)

### ChromaDB Collection Strategies

Currently: One `message_memory` collection for all campaigns

**Alternative:** One collection per campaign

**Pros:**

- Easier to delete entire campaign (drop collection)
- Better isolation between campaigns

**Cons:**

- ChromaDB has collection limits
- Semantic search across campaigns harder

**Current approach is correct for this use case.**
