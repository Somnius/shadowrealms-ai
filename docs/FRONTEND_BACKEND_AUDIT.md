## ‚ùå What's MISSING or BROKEN

### Known Gaps

#### Backend Gaps
1. **WebSocket/Real-time**: No WebSocket implementation for live chat
2. **Character Routes**: Limited character API endpoints
3. **Message History**: No persistent message storage API
4. **File Upload**: No character image upload support
5. **Search API**: No dedicated search endpoint for messages/content

#### Frontend Gaps
1. **Character Creation Form**: May exist but not tested
2. **Rule Book Viewer**: No UI component for browsing rule books
3. **Settings Page**: No user settings interface

## üîç NEXT STEP

**Let's start with Phase 5A.1**: Open the frontend in a browser and see what actually works!

```bash
# Open your browser to:
http://localhost

# Or if on different port:
http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:80
```

**What to check**:
1. Does the login page appear?
2. Any errors in browser console?
3. Can you click buttons?
4. Do API calls appear in Network tab?

**Report back what you see and we'll fix issues one by one!**
