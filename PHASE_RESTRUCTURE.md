## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Model Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Download all missing models
2. Create ModelRouter system
3. Implement basic orchestration
4. Test all models individually

### Step 2: RAG System (Week 2)
1. Integrate ChromaDB properly
2. Implement vector search
3. Create context retrieval
4. Test with sample campaign data

### Step 3: RPG Integration (Week 3)
1. Add dice rolling mechanics
2. Implement character integration
3. Create world navigation
4. Test full RPG workflow

### Step 4: Polish & Testing (Week 4)
1. Campaign continuity testing
2. Performance optimization
3. User interface improvements
4. Full system testing

## Technical Requirements

### Model Requirements
- **MythoMakiseMerged-13B**: 13B parameters, ~8GB VRAM
- **DreamGen Opus V1**: World-building specialized
- **Llama 3.1 70B**: 70B parameters, ~40GB VRAM
- **Eva Qwen2.5**: Creative roleplay
- **Meltemi**: Greek language, ~7B parameters
- **OpenEuroLLM-Greek**: Greek support
- **command-r:35b**: 35B parameters, ~20GB VRAM

### System Requirements
- **Total VRAM**: ~80GB+ (for all models)
- **RAM**: 64GB+ recommended
- **Storage**: 500GB+ for models
- **GPU**: RTX 4090 or multiple GPUs

### Architecture Changes Needed
1. **ModelRouter**: Central model management
2. **VectorService**: ChromaDB integration
3. **TranslationService**: Greek/English pipeline
4. **RPGEngine**: Game mechanics integration
5. **MemoryService**: Campaign continuity

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All planned models working
- [ ] RAG system providing context-aware responses
- [ ] RPG mechanics fully integrated
- [ ] Campaign continuity working
- [ ] Greek language support functional
- [ ] Friends can play a complete campaign

## Risk Mitigation
- **Model Size**: Start with smaller models, scale up
- **VRAM Limits**: Implement model swapping
- **Complexity**: Build incrementally, test each component
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize continuously
